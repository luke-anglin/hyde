  Hey, thanks for stopping by! I'm an engineer who authors books as my passion project. I just wrote a dystopian, fiction novel about the a world taken over by companies after an apocalypse. You can find a summary and more information about my first book, <em>Anaconda's Prime</em> of <em>The Afterburn Trilogy</em>, <a href="{{site.baseurl | append: '/books/'}}">here</a>.

  When I'm not writing or programming, I love to play sports! Beach volleyball is certainly my favorite. I'm also trilingual and play the guitar, but my biggest obsession is with my therapy dog Maya!

A little about me - I graduated the University of Virginia's School of Engineering in three years. I previously worked at Tesla as a data scientist, and now I'm working at Ernst & Young.

More important than any of that is my family. We're kind of weird. Here are some pictures . . .
