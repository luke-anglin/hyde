  Hey, thanks for stopping by! I'm an engineer who authors books as my passion project. I just wrote a dystopian, fiction novel about the a world taken over by companies after an apocalypse. You can find a summary and more information about my first book, <em>Anaconda's Prime</em> of <em>The Afterburn Trilogy</em>, <a href="{{site.baseurl | append: '/books/'}}">here</a>.

  When I'm not writing or programming, I love to play sports! Beach volleyball is certainly my favorite. I'm also trilingual and play the guitar, but my biggest obsession is with my therapy dog Maya!

A little about me - I graduated the University of Virginia's School of Engineering in three years. I previously worked at Tesla as a data scientist, and now I'm working at Ernst & Young.

More important than any of that is my family. We're kind of weird. Here are some pictures . . .

My book, _Brain Storm_, is largely a Christian allegory. If you're not a Christian, the book doesn't require any Christian or biblical knowledge to read by any means. But the most important thing about me, above everything else I've said, is that I worship the Lord Jesus Christ, and that I will never deny.

> For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.

<p>So yeah! Check out my book, check out the other links on the sidebar to random engineering stuff . . . whatever floats your goat!</p>
