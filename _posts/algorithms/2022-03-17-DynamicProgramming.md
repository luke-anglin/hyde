- Uses **memoization** to save values for later computations
- Requires an **optimal substructure** - solutions to larger problems use smaller optimal solutions

## Strategy

1. Identify the recursive structure - what is the last thing done?
2. Save solutions in memory
3. Choose **top down** for recursive solutions, and **bottom up** for iterative approaches
