# Graph Cuts

- **Cut** - A partition of a graph $(V, E)$ into two sets $S$ and $V-S$. You either respect or cross the cut

## Cut Theorem

- A set of edges $A \subseteq T$, where $T$ is an MST, let $(S, V-S)$ be any cut which $A$ respects. $A \cup \{e\}$ is also a subset of an MST.

# Flow Networks

- Graph $G = (V, E)$
- Source node $s \in V$
- Sink node $t \in V$
- Edge capacities $c(e) \in \mathbb{R}^+$
- Inflow must equal outflow $\forall v \in V - \{s, t\}$
- **Augmenting paths** contains only
  - Non-full forward edges
  - Non-empty backward edges
- **Bottleneck capacity** - edge in augmenting path with lowest capacity

# Residual Graphs

- $G_f$ models additional flow that is possible
  - Forward edge - how much flow could I add? $c(e) - f(e)$
  - Backward edge - how much flow could I remove? $f(e)$

# [Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl90tNtKvxs&ab_channel=MichaelSambol)

1. Initialize $f(e) = 0$ for all $e \in E$
2. Construct residual network $G_f$
3. While there is an augmenting path $p$ in $G_f$:

- $c$ = bottleneck capacity (may be a difference of $c(e) - f(e)$ at some node, not just $c(e)$ unless it's the first iteration)
- Add $c$ unit of flows to $G$ based on augmenting path $p$

## Number of Iterations?

- Integer-valued capacities, min-weight is 1, number of iterations is bounded by max flow ($|f^*|$)
- Rational values - integer capacity, $\approx 2^{32}$
- Irrational values could lead to an infinite loop

## Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

Same thing except for step 3 - while there is an augmenting path, let $p$ be the path with the fewest hops. $\Theta(\text{min}(Ef^*, VE^2))$

## Showing correctness of Ford-Fulkerson/Showing max flow

- $MaxFlow$ is $\Theta(E*V)$
- Build the cut by ssurrounding the areas when augmenting paths stop
- Sum forward edges that cross the cut

# Edge-Disjoint Paths

**Reduction** - convert vertex-disjoint problem into edge-disjoint by copying each node, one connected to incoming edges and one to outgoing

# Maximum bipartite matching (dog lovers and dogs)

Problem statement - a graph $(L, R, E)$

$\Theta(E*V)$

1. Make $G$ into $G'$
2. Compute max flow on $G'$
3. Return $M$ as all 'middle edges' with flow 1

MBM is a reduction of MF

# Reductions

**Easier problem reduces to the harder problem**. If $A$ reduces to $B$, we denote this as $A \le_p B$, unless it reduces linearly, in which we denote it $A \le_n B$

## Examples

- EDP reduces to MF
- VDP reduces to EDP reduces to MF
- MBM reduces to MF

## Runtime

- `convert(A->B)`
- `execute(B)` - we want this to be the slow part
- `solve(B->A)`

## Lower bound proofs

We know that if $A \in \Omega(f(n))$ then $B \in \Omega(f(n))$, so $A \le_p B$

### Maximum Independent Set

$S \subseteq V$ is an independent set if no two nodes in $S$ share an edge

### Generalized Baseball (MinVertCov)

- Fewest number of defenders needed

### Conversion from MIS to MVC

- $S$ is an independent set of $G$ iff $V - S$ is a vertex cover of $G$

### Proof

- Consider any edge $E \in V$, there must be only one endpoint of $v_1 \oplus v_2 \in S$, and the other must be in the complement
