title: Greedy Algos and Sorting

# Greedy Algorithm

- Chooses what's best _right now_ and doesn't look into the future
- Suitable for **optimization problems**
- Our solution to the **coin problem** was greedy

# Sorting

- **Adjacent sort** - always $\Omega(n^2)$ and can never be $o(n^2)$ (ex. the stable insertion sort)

## Inversions

- An out-of-order pair
- Max of $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ inversions
- Every swap **fixes only one inversion**

## Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort is an optimal solution for adjacent elements, because it runs in $O(n^2)$
