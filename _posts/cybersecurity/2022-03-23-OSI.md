# OSI

Note when people say 'layer $x$' they mean OSI not TCP/IP

- Layer seven - Application - UI (only for networks)
- Layer six - Presentation - data formatting, encryption
- Layer five - Session - process-to-process communictation, TLS handshake
- Layer four - Transport - end-to-end communication maintenance, flow control and error control
- Layer three - Session - Logical implementation of IP addresses, routing data, WAN delivery, packet delivery
- Layer two - Data link - Local, MAC connections, physical addressing
- Layer one - Physical - physics signaling

# TCP-IP

# WAN

- Can't guarantee security or privacy
- Private leased lines
- Cable, DSL, fiber, satellite, cellular, dial-up

# Network Security risks

- Reconnaissance - gathering info
- Eavesdropping - 'taps a cable' to see all data passing through
- DOS/DDOS

# Types of Filtering

- Static filtering
  - Fixed rules
  - Does not look at payload, only header
  - Does not consider communication streams
- Stateful inspection
  - Assesses communication streams
  - Often inspects payload
  - Handles connectionless protocols too

# NAT table

- Saves IP address space and makes it more efficient

# Proxy Server

- Sits in the middle
- NAT - changes your IP address on the proxy server to protect you, making you anonymous
- Content filtering
- Caching

# Firewall Rules

- `DENY ALL` - deny anything you're not allowing

# VPN

- PPTP
- SSL/TLS
- IPSec

# Network Access Control (NACs)

- Authentication
- Posture checking - if I sign into eduoram wifi with my NetBadge, it checks my system and makes sure my antivirus and other stuff is up to date

# Wireless Network Security Controls

- Segment
- Authenticate
- VPN over Wireless
- Wireless encryption - WPA2 or WPA3
- SSID broadcast - turn off!
- MAC address filtering
