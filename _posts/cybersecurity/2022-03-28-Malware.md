- Malicious software (malware) - any program that carries out actions that aren't desired
- Malicious code attacks all three informatino properties (CIA)

# How a virus works

Viruses **must attach to a host**

- Infection vector - some way to spread. Includes a routine that finds target files and a replicate routine to copy itself onto the target program
- Trigger - a **logic bomb**, the action that brings the payload to fruition (some double-click, a time/date . . .)
- Payload - delete files, eavesdropping, stealing data . . .

# Rootkits

- Hides itself on computer by replacing an existing program
- Modify the OS to conceal itself
- Provide attackers with access to compromised computers so they can launch more attacks
- Difficult to detect and remove

# Worms

- Doesn't require an activation by the host

## Process

1. Infect host
2. Sends itself to other hosts, without anything done by user
3. Propagation continues until some worm-triggering condition expires or security patches come in

# StuxNet

1. Infection - enters via a USB to infect any Windows computer and obtaining a digital certificate that makes it look like a reliable company
2. Search - check to see if a machine is part of some control system made by Siemens (high-speed Iranian centrifuge machines for nuclear)
3. Update - ignore non-targets, if it hits a target, download most recent version from Internet
4. Compromise - exploit zero day vulnerabilities in the logic controllers
5. Control - control the centrifigues and force them to spin themselves to failure
6. Deceive and estroy - tell outside controllers that everything is fine.
