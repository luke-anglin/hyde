<a name="exploits"><h1>Exploits</h1></a>

Using software, scripts, or commands to take advantage of a vulnerability is called **exploitation**

## Types of Exploits

- Malware - viruses, worms, ransomware
- Network Exploits - DOS, Sniffing, spoofing, replay, reflection, MITM, wireless attacks
- Software Exploits - Vulnerabilities in software, vulnerabilities in configuration of software applications (OS things . . .)

## Software Vulnerabilities

### Ways

- Bugs
- Inject malware
- Execute malware
- Create backdoor
- Steal data

### General

- Error dealing with large inputs
  - Buffer overflow
  - Ping of death (network software exploit)
- Error in not restricting the type of input
  - XSS
  - SQL Injection
  - Land attack (network software exploit)

## Kinds of Buffer Overflows

- Heap-based
- Stack-based
- Fingerd
- OpenSSL

### Mitigations

### Shellcode

- Written in machine code
- Often returns/opens a shell for the attacker
- Injected into memory
- NOPs (no operation) - `\x90\x90\x90\x90`

# Metasploit

- Penetration testing framework
- Gives you a root or user shell depending on exploit
- Uses modules, which are just scripts, via command line commands

## Commands

- `msfconsole` - gives you the Metasploit Framework cmd line program
- `msfconsole search` - allows you to search by CVE #, Metasploit module name, or word/parts of word for a specific exploit for your pen testing
- `msfconsole use`
  - Loads exploit
  - Have to use full path in the name column of the `msfconsole search` results
  - After using this command, the prompt will change from `msf` to whatever the exploit is named
  - See options with `options` command once in this new shell
  - Run with `exploit` after options are set

## Options

- `RHOST` - Remote host and is the IP address of the target
- Use `set` to set an option - ex. `set rhost target_ip`
- `PAYLOAD` also required for some attacks (ex. reverse_tcp)

<a name="secops"><h1>Security Operations</h1></a>

There is an **SOC** (Security Operations Center) and potentially a **NOC** (Network Operations Center)

## Goals of an SOC

- Provide a means to **report** incidents
- Provide **handling** to constituents
- **Disseminate** info about the incidents to constituents/external parties

# Security administration

## Positions

- Security analyst - From tier 1 (greenies) to tier 3 (seniors, generally take large issues, in free time pen test and vulnerability test)
- Security engineer/architect
- SOC manager - oversees the analysts, reports to CISO
- CISO - Chief Information Security Officer (first guy to get fired)
- Incident response manager - manages technical aspects of responding to incidents

## Roles

- Control access
- Documentation, procedures, guidelines
  - critical (sensitive) assets list
  - organization's security process
  - policies, procedures, guidelines
  - compliance (regulatory (laws) or organizational)
- Disaster assessment and recovery
  - incident response team
  - emergency operations group

## Security Administration Responsibilities

- Implement/manage security tools
- Investigate suspicious activities and put them down
- Prevent downtime through DDOS or just when the company has to shut down to kill an incident
- Strategy on the security front
- Audit and compliance support

## Security outsourcing

- Advantages
  - More expertise
- Disadvantages
  - The outsourcing firm doesn't know enough about the internal
  - No in-house capability
  - Privacy/data security concerns (addressed below)
  - IP Ownership and legalistics (addressed below)

### Common outsourcing agreements

- Service-level agreement - **SLA** - who does what?
- Blanket purchase agreement - **BPA** - payment details
- Memorandum of understanding - **MOU** - commitment to each other, letter of intent, what we want to do
- Interconnection of security agreement - **ISA** - technical requirements of interconnected assets - who owns what?

## Compliance

- Event logs
  - Too much will reduce processing speed and hog disk
- Compliance liaison - prevent setting weak passwords, for example.
- Remediation - fixing non-compliance, fixing broken things

# Professional Ethics

- Be an example
- Encourage ethical procedures
- Inform users about security things

## Professional requirements

An organization should . . .

- collect only what it needs
- not share info/data
- keep its information updated
- only use information for the purposes it was collected
- destroy information that is no longer necessary

# Personnel Security Principles

- Limiting Access
  - Least privilege or need to know - only grant access to what a user needs
- Separation of duties
  - Different users must contribute to get something done - you can't create a new vendor and cut a check to that vendor
- Job rotation - prevents collusion
- Mandatory vacations
  - Another person will do their duties, preventing fraud
- Security training and awareness
  - Social engineering specifically (intimidation, name-dropping, appeals for help, phishing)

# Infrastructure Policies

## Security Policy Hierarchy

![](https://i.imgur.com/BlCpYV0.png)

- Guidelines - NIST writes SP 800 guidelines

### Terms

- Functional policy - an organization's management diretion for security in functional areas like email, remote access, Internet surfing . . . use words like _will_ and _should_
  - Privacy policies are an example
- Mandated requirements for hardware and software that address risks in the organization
  - Antivirus
  - Password generation token
- Baselines - basic security configs
- Guidelines - generally for acceptable system purchases

## Data Classification Standards

Mandatory access control (MAC) requires these standards

- Value
- Sensitivity - how bad is it if it gets posted on WikiLeaks
- Criticality - if this was lost, what's gonna happen?

## Configuration Management

- Process of managing changes to existing configurations
- Evaluates how modifications might affect security

Things you might want

- Hardware configuration chart
- Patch and service pack management - checks often for updates/changes

### Change Management Process

- Configuration control - management of baseline settings for a system device
- Change control - management of changes
  - Peer review
  - back out plans
  - documentation

### Change Control Procedure

## Software Development Life cycle

![](https://i.imgur.com/EApXTFq.png)

- No going backwards! Make a new version like 1.1

# Software Assurance, Development and Security

- Validate input
- Handle errors and exceptions

<a name="secaud"><h1>Security Assessments and Auditing</h1></a>

## Addressing Risk - The Security Cycle

Four activities - remember **MAIS**, like a crop cycle (because it's a security cycle)

- Monitor
- Audit
- Improve
- Secure

## Permission Levels

- Promiscuous - everything allowed
- Permissive - anything not specifically prohibited
- Prudent
- Paranoid - very few things permitted

## Categories

- Security audit - often necessary for regulations
- Vulnerability assessment - no exploits, looks to see what is out there
- Penetration test - tries to exploit, rules of engagement (ROE) are very important

## Security Auditing

- Checking operations
- Asks:
  - Are policies understood and followed
  - Are the proper security controls in place
- Purpose:
  - Appropriate - Is the level of security control suitable for the risk it addresses?
  - Installed correctly
  - Addressing purpose

Auditing benchmarks - ISO 27002, CSF, ITIL, COBIT, COSO

### Audit Planning and Implementation

- Survey the site
- Review documentation
- Review risk analysis output - what are the critical systems (the database, perhaps? the accounting server for banking?)
- Review server and application logs - are there errors? are configs/permissions changing
- Review incident logs -
- Review results of penetration tests

### Collecting Audit Data

- Questionanaires
- Interviews
- Observation
- Checklists
- Reviewing documentation
- Reviewing configurations
- Reviewing policy
- Performing security testing

### Audit Areas

![Audit areas](https://i.imgur.com/CZgDv5f.png)

### Security Audit Report

- Findings
- Recommendations
  - Timeline for implementation
  - Level of risk
  - Management response
- Follow-up

### Post-Audit Activities

- Exit Interview
- Data Analysis

### Vulnerability vs. Penetration Testing

![V vs P](https://i.imgur.com/DPgtfq6.png)

#### Report format (both)

- Executive summary - for the Scott's of the world
- Summary of findings and recommendations
- Detailed findings
- Methodology
- References
- Appendices

## Security Monitoring

- Baselines
- Alarms, alerts, trends,
- CCTV
- Systems that spot irregular behavior

### Security Monitoring for Computer systems

- Real-time: host and network IDS, system integrity monitoring, data loss prevention (DLP)
- Non-real-time: application and system logging
- Log activities: host-based activity (startups and shutdowns), network and network devices (performance, logins . . .)

#### Types of log information to capture

**False positives** and **false negatives**!

- Event logs - general
- Access logs - requests for resources
- Security logs - security-related
- Audit logs - any events that provide more input to auditing

# IDSes

## Analysis methods

- Pattern or signature based IDSes: rule-based detection, pattern matching, stateful matching, known signatures for malwares and attacks
- Anomaly-based IDSes: Profile-based systems
- Common methods of detecting anomalies: Statistical methods, traffic methods, protocol patterns

# Backups

- Full
- Incremental
- Differential - only backs up the files that are different from the latest full backup

# Web servers and applications

## Parts

- Front end
- Application server
- Database server

## Common setups

- Apache
- Nginx
- IIS
- Open source setup: linux (the OS) apache (the web server) mysql (the relational DB) and php (application layer)

### Common misconfigurations

- Default passwords
- TLS certificates
- Scripts
- Remote admin
- Third party apps

## Web server attack methodology

1. Information gathering (`robots.txt`)
2. Web server footprinting - banner grabbing, getting mroe information
3. Website mirroring - `wget`
4. Vulnerability scanning - `nikto`
5. Session hijacking - XSS
6. Web server password cracking

## Attacks

- DoS
- MiTM
- Phishing
- Directory traversal up to `root`
- Hidden code
- Web cache poisoning
- Hidden code - `<input type=hidden name = "price">`

## Attack tools

- Wfetch
- Brutus
- THC-Hydra
- Metasploit

<a name="crypto"><h1>Cryptography</h1></a>

# Language and Cryptanalysis

- **Frequency Analysis** - most common English letter is E
- Create tables of double (digram) and triple (trigram)

# Cryptography Terms

- Encrypted information - ciphertext
- Key - a string of numbers or characters used to encrypt or decrypt information

## Cipher Categories

- **Private, symmetric** - same key to encrypt/decrypt
- **Public, assymetric** - different keys to encrypt/decrypt

## Cryptography's Role in Information Security

Remember **CIAN** like the color

- Confidentiality - secret from unauthorized users
- Integrity - ensures that no one, even the sender, changes data after transmission - go ahead and hash too, so that if someone changes something you'll know
- Authentication
- Nonrepudiation - prevents a party from denying a previous statement or action

## Transposition Ciphers

- Encrypt in a table and permute columns based on keyword/key set

![TC](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sHsnH1u03e4/maxresdefault.jpg)

## Substitution Ciphers

### Keyword mixed alphabet cipher

Remove a few letters from a word, throw in the rest of the letters, substitution cipher after that

![](https://i.imgur.com/wPj23iJ.png)

### Vigenére

- Encrypts every letter with its own substition scheme
- Matrix table that shifts alphabet each row
- Uses a keyword that matches the length of the message
- Breaks frequency analysis

![Vigenére](https://i.imgur.com/Pq3KCii.png)

### Simple Substitution Cipher

Allows any letter to uniquely map to any other letter (vigenére included)

### Rot13

Modification of Caesar cipher, shifts by 13 rather than 3
