Using software, scripts, or commands to take advantage of a vulnerability is called **exploitation**

## Types of Exploits

- Malware - viruses, worms, ransomware
- Network Exploits - DOS, Sniffing, spoofing, replay, reflection, MITM, wireless attacks
- Software Exploits - Vulnerabilities in software, vulnerabilities in configuration of software applications (OS things . . .)

## Software Vulnerabilities

### Ways

- Bugs
- Inject malware
- Execute malware
- Create backdoor
- Steal data

### General

- Error dealing with large inputs
  - Buffer overflow
  - Ping of death (network software exploit)
- Error in not restricting the type of input
  - XSS
  - SQL Injection
  - Land attack (network software exploit)

## Kinds of Buffer Overflows

- Heap-based
- Stack-based
- Fingerd
- OpenSSL

### Mitigations

### Shellcode

- Written in machine code
- Often returns/opens a shell for the attacker
- Injected into memory
- NOPs (no operation) - `\x90\x90\x90\x90`
