<a name="osi"><h1>OSI</h1></a>

Note when people say 'layer $x$' they mean OSI not TCP/IP

- Layer seven - Application - UI (only for networks)
- Layer six - Presentation - data formatting, encryption
- Layer five - Session - process-to-process communictation, TLS handshake
- Layer four - Transport - end-to-end communication maintenance, flow control and error control
- Layer three - Session - Logical implementation of IP addresses, routing data, WAN delivery, packet delivery
- Layer two - Data link - Local, MAC connections, physical addressing
- Layer one - Physical - physics signaling

# TCP-IP

![](https://i.imgur.com/UgiMdKY.png)

# WAN

- Can't guarantee security or privacy
- Private leased lines
- Cable, DSL, fiber, satellite, cellular, dial-up

# Network Security risks

- Reconnaissance - gathering info
- Eavesdropping - 'taps a cable' to see all data passing through
- DOS/DDOS

# Types of Filtering

- Static filtering
  - Fixed rules
  - Does not look at payload, only header
  - Does not consider communication streams
- Stateful inspection
  - Assesses communication streams
  - Often inspects payload
  - Handles connectionless protocols too

# NAT table

- Saves IP address space and makes it more efficient

# Proxy Server

- Sits in the middle
- NAT - changes your IP address on the proxy server to protect you, making you anonymous
- Content filtering
- Caching

# Firewall Rules

- `DENY ALL` - deny anything you're not allowing

# VPN

- PPTP
- SSL/TLS
- IPSec

# Network Access Control (NACs)

- Authentication
- Posture checking - if I sign into eduoram wifi with my NetBadge, it checks my system and makes sure my antivirus and other stuff is up to date

# Wireless Network Security Controls

- Segment
- Authenticate
- VPN over Wireless
- Wireless encryption - WPA2 or WPA3
- SSID broadcast - turn off!
- MAC address filtering

<a name="malware"><h1>Malware</h1></a>

- Malicious software (malware) - any program that carries out actions that aren't desired
- Malicious code attacks all three informatino properties (CIA)

# How a virus works

Viruses **must attach to a host**

- Infection vector - some way to spread. Includes a routine that finds target files and a replicate routine to copy itself onto the target program
- Trigger - a **logic bomb**, the action that brings the payload to fruition (some double-click, a time/date . . .)
- Payload - delete files, eavesdropping, stealing data . . .

# Rootkits

- Hides itself on computer by replacing an existing program
- Modify the OS to conceal itself
- Provide attackers with access to compromised computers so they can launch more attacks
- Difficult to detect and remove

# Worms

- Doesn't require an activation by the host

## Process

1. Infect host
2. Sends itself to other hosts, without anything done by user
3. Propagation continues until some worm-triggering condition expires or security patches come in

# StuxNet

1. Infection - enters via a USB to infect any Windows computer and obtaining a digital certificate that makes it look like a reliable company
2. Search - check to see if a machine is part of some control system made by Siemens (high-speed Iranian centrifuge machines for nuclear)
3. Update - ignore non-targets, if it hits a target, download most recent version from Internet
4. Compromise - exploit zero day vulnerabilities in the logic controllers
5. Control - control the centrifigues and force them to spin themselves to failure
6. Deceive and estroy - tell outside controllers that everything is fine.

# Trojan Horses

- Largest class of malware
- Any program that seems legitimate but hides malicious code
- Relies on social engineering
- Spreads in many ways (email, website downloads, networking sites, bots)

# Logic Bombs

- Waits until some time/condition b4 execution
- Typically associated with **insiders** (often disgruntled)

# Botnets

Not malware, but _used to launch malware_ or launch spam (often including malware)

1. Infection
2. Connection
3. Control
4. Multiplication

# Smurf

- Ping overload DOS attack

# Keystroke logger

- Capture keystrokes and send back to attacker

# Guidelines for recognizing hoaxes

- Did a legitimate entity send the alert
- Is there a request to forward it to others?
- Are there detailed explanations or terminology?
- Does the alert follow the generic chain letter format?

# Homepage Hijacking

- Reset homepage of a browser
- Covertly install a BHO browser helper object Trojan

# Webpage Defacements

- Someone gaining unauthorized access to a web server and altering the index page of a site on the server
- Replaces the original pages on the site with altered versions

# Malware analysis

- Determine nature/purpose of malware
- Understand the inner workings, how to detect, how to destroy
- How was the target compromised? How big of a deal is the compromise?
- Analyze the suspect binary in a sandbox.

## Analysis methods

- Static analysis - examining code without executing application
- Dynamic analysis - testing during runtime
- Code analysis
  - Static - debugging and disassembly
  - Dynamic - debugging and disassembly
- Memory analysis - what was placed in RAM and what artifacts are there

## Binary Discovery - Finding Malware

- `find / -executable -type f` - return executables
- `file /bin/cat`
- `ls -alt /bin/`
- `updatedb`
- `locate 'cat`
- `which bash`

# Static Analysis Process

Not running the program, but inspecting it

1. `file testfile` - where `testfile` is the file we're nervous about
2. `strings testfile` - shows you different unique strings 'GLIB_2', 'UH-P', 'PASSWORD: Hi!'
3. `readelf -h testfile` - show file header
4. `objdump -f testfile`
5. `hexdump`
6. `ldd` - shared libraries

# Dynamic Analysis - Monitoring

- Process monitoring - Process Monitor
- File system monitoring - iNotify
- Registry monitoring - regshot
- Network monitoring - Wireshark

# Dynamic Analysis - Steps

- Clean snapshot
- Running the monitoring tools
- Run the malware
- Stop the monitoring tools
- Analyze the results

# Code Analysis - Static

- `ndiasm -a -p intel testfile | more` or `objdump -D -M intel testflie`

# Code Analysis - Dynamic

## gdb

`gdb testfile` - allows you to set breakpoints

- Could also use `edb` - graphical debugger
- Could use `strace` which examines system calls, or `ltrace` which examines dynamic library calls

## Other disassemblers/debuggers

- IDAPro
- Ghidra

# [Worms, Fuzzing, iptables and Snort](#worms)

# Fuzzing

- Fuzzing is sending invalid data in hopes of causing an error (buffer overflow, segfault . . . )
  - Not just random input
  - Infinite space problem - infinite # of malformed input (infinite monkey theorem, eventually you'll cause an invalid input)
  - Mutational fuzzing - truncating/changing the vald input data
  - Generational fuzzing - has inside information about the application, tailors the fuzzes to that (open source software, unit testing . . . )
  - Heartbleed - example of above, in 2014, was a major vulnerability in OpenSSL relating to the heartbeat TLS connection (avoids repeating the handshake) (found by ethical hackers, and all was safe)

# CTF summary tips

- `strings <file>` to see if the flag is obvious
- `file <file>` to determine the type of the executable
- `chmod +x <file>` to make executable
- Run the program and see what it doees
- Fuzz the program to make it fail ungracefully, if possible
- Disassemble
  - `ndisasm -a <file>`
  - `objdump -D <file>`
- Debug
  - `gdb <file>`
  - `edb --run <file>`

# Slammer (Sapphire) Worm

- Fastest worm in history, affected >90% of vulnerable hosts in 10 mins
- 376 bytes
- Exploited MS SQL server
- Buffer overflow
- UDP port 1434
- Spreads via random IPs
- DoS (accidental)

## Slammer - the vulnerability

- `Ssnetlib.dll`
- `Sqlservr.exe`
- Builds 3 strings together into a 128 byte buffer in the stack, the second string, the database name, which _should_ be 16 chars or left.
- Top left corner of the datagram like the `04` in the picture signals the name of the database
- Uses `GetTickCount` as a seed for a random IP, then shuffles bits
- Sends data to jump to it's own code

## Blocking slammer

- `WS2_32!sentto()` API - blocks certain `sendto` calls
- Send blocking
- Stack tracing - sees that `sent to` is pointing to its own code, which shows its a worm
- Caller's address (CA)
- `buf <= CA < buf + len` - see if the worm code is included in the buffer: if `True`, then that's probably a worm!
- `buf: 0x1050db73 <= 0x1050dce9 < 0x1050dceb`

## Mitigation

- Reboot
- Patches
  - MS 02-039
  - SQL 2000 Service Pack 3
- ACL/Firewall rules on UDP port 1434

# iptables

- Linux-based IPv4 packet filter stored in `/usr/sbin/iptables`
- Uses the x_tables kernel module
- Chains have a default policy and rules
- Five predefined chains
  - PREROUTING - before routing decisions are made
  - INPUT - controls the behavior of any packets coming directly to that system - `iptables -P INPUT DROP`
  - FORWARD - incoming connections destined for a later computer (i.e they're forwarded)
  - OUTPUT - outgoing packets from that machine (will use this in lab)
  - POSTROUTING - after routing decisions are made
- Three most common policies and rules are **ACCEPT, DROP and REJECT**

## iptables Usage

- `iptables [command-type] [pattern-match options] -j [action]`
- `iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.10/24 -j ACCEPT`
- `-A` - APPEND to input chain
- `-p tcp` - protocol
- `--dport ssh` - destination port ssh/22
- CIDR for a network range, just an IP for one

## iptables Important Connection States and Ports

- Generally the ports and the connection states are missed, need **new and established on INPUT**, only **established on OUTPUT**
- Make sure you use `-p tcp`
- `--dport ssh` is for the input because it's destined for our ssh port
- `--sport 22` is for the output because it's coming _from_ our ssh port
- `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -s 192.168.100.10 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT`
  - Allows new and established connections in
- `iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -d 192.168.100.10 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT`
  - Only allows established connections out

## Rule saving

- Saving rules - `sudo /sbin/iptables-save`
- Listing rules - `iptables -L`
- Clear rules - `iptables -F`

# Snort Rules

`[action] [protocol] [source IP] [source port] [direction] [destination IP] [destination port]` - rule header
