## <em>Anaconda's Prime</em>

2030 was the most catastrophic year the world ever knew. The earth was charred by the Plague bomb, habitable land reduced to a minuscule plot known known as 'The Union.' Ten ruthless companies replaced all legitimate forms of government. Each year, the Relegation is held, where the weakest corporation is absorbed into the strongest.

Now 2035, Mowgli’s father has been captured and Asana’s father killed. Forcefully taken by drone to Anaconda Inc., they're plunged headfirst into the dark schemes of the Union. Slowly uncovering Union secrets kept under lock and key, they realize that the Plague had more effects on the human genome than they originally expected. Only by banding together can they exact revenge and defeat their enemies.
