## <em>Anaconda's Prime</em>

2030 was the most catastropic year the world ever knew. The earth charred by the Plague bomb, habitable land was reduced to a minuscule plot known known as 'The Union.' Ten ruthless companies replaced all legitimate forms of government. Each year, the Relegation is held, where the weakest corporation is absorbed into the strongest.

<!-- After Mowgli’s father is captured by Anaconda Inc.’s militia, Mowgli finds himself infiltrating the merciless company’s headquarters. It’s not long before he realizes that the Union is a darker place than he ever could’ve imagined. The chances of getting his father back shrink to none, and the only thing Mowgli can do is foil the plans of Agrippa, the most powerful woman in the world.

In the midst of the chaos, Asana’s father is discovered with contraband and is killed by the militia of Anaconda Inc. Asana is forcefully taken by drone to Anaconda. Soon learning of the dark secrets the Union keeps—specifically the Plague-induced mutations—she discovers the identity of her true enemies while seeking vengeance for her father. -->

Mowgli's father has been captured. Asana's has been killed. They've both been captured by drone, plunged into the Union's dark plots themselves. Only together can they navigate the secretive company Anaconda Inc. and defeat their enemies.
